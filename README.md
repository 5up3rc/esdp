esdp
=====

esdp (Erlang Software Defined Perimeter) 
is an OTP application 
to provide security for small cloud applets running restful API's.

Premise is cloud economics will change design paradigm from large appliance security devices to 
small discrete distributed concurrent atomic functions with well-defined API's.
This work is aimed at restful NextGenNetwork (IpV6) https api's between cloud servers.

Software Defined Perimeter (SDP)s:
   - Single Packet Authorization (SPA)
   - Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)
   - Device Validation
   - Dynamic Pinhole Firewalls
   - Application Binding
