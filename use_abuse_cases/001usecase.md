=====
This use case is a variant off the base use case. 
The particular focus of this use case is describing the steady state
communications between the webserver and the application server.

The relevant control in this case is the already established IPSEC connection
between the relevant application on the webserver 
and the relevant application.

For this use case it is assumed the esdp controller established this connection as part of spinning up these machines (details in another use case).
Other



A person, using their device, accesses (over the internet) some cloud resources.
The overall objective is to add eSDP as security controls not this architecture.
